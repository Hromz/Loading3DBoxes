# Loading2DBoxes
Loading bxes into container.
This is my pet project that still in development.
Requires user to input quantity, lenght, width and height. After that calculates optimal box loading and print graphical representation of loading in container.
Right now i'm using coordinates system for collision detection and box representation inside container.
